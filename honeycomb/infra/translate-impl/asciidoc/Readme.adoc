= Honeycomb translation layer implementation

Provides composite implementations of child, list and root readers/writers.

Root readers/writers can be used to provide data translation at root node level.
List readers/writers help with data translation for nodes modeled as YANG lists.
Child readers/writers can be used to provide data translation for non-leaf nodes.

Readers and writers can be easily extended using customizers defined in the translate-spi module.
